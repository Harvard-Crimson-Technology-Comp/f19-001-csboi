Question 5. What is a Web API?

# It acts as a middle layer between the user and the server by handling the
lower level operations of the server based on the users requests. It can be
used to serve data to the user, or to computationally edit elements of the
DOM without having to request new html from the server, for instance

Question 6. What is a "backend"?

# Backend will not directly be seen by the user. If the Web API is the
middle layer, frontend is from the API to the user, backend is from
the API to the server. This covers all of the scripts actively run on
the server and the handling and parsing of data from the server to the API.
